          <h3>Service 1</h3>
          <p>This section should allow someone to answer the question do they do what I need to get done in less than 5 seconds. General categories/ or whatever is felt is a fit for the industry. </p>

          <h3>Service 2</h3>
          <p>The text for each servie should ?explains? what the service is. Explains: a clarification between the user (person looking at the site) and business that they are on the same page about what exactly (Service 2) entails, in the case there is any ambiguity in the term. Possibly tech jargon, purspose to say hey we know what the hell we are talking about, check out these big words (legitimacy). Something more general if believe the first contact (ie person using website) won't necessarily know tech jargon and is doing intial research before passing on to someone that would.</p>

          <h3>Service 3</h3>
          <p>After figuring out what the services are. Probably either try to find/create custom icons. Possiby use small pictures that represent that service. Probably should be shorter than whats currently in Service 2, need to test on phone and reread content strategy book that talked about digestable paragraph lengths.</p>
